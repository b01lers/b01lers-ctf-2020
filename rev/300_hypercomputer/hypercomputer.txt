hypercomputer   (created by dm)
-------------

There is always hope, Commander,
until the ship annihilates -
rig the hybrid simulator
if you seek good coordinates.
(Needs patience... I'll skip the lecture,
 good we have real architecture!)

Users get:
  - hypercomputer (binary)
  - a netcat address/port (use the /server folder to run a local server)
