hypercomputer 2     (created by dm)
---------------

Think, Commander,
  before you enter
what is needed -
  and when that's run,
ones and zeroes  
  boogie to your will:
Droids thwarted / 
  your flag'll be dumped.

Users get:
  - hypercomputer2 (binary)
  - a netcat address/port (again as with hypercomputer1, use /server and its files to run a local server)
