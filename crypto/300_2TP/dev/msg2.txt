If you got this far, then you're on the right track. In crypto classes it's often said that reusing a one-time pad even once is a colossal mistake, but not many can readily exploit that. I was thinking about making the job here easier by restricting plaintexts to uppercase letters and space only, however, we both know that that's unnecessary. Alas, enough chitchat, I suppose you came for the flag. Submit the following seven-word sentence, including punctuation, with words separated by underscores and vowels converted to leetspeak: "See, I can walk the walk too!". Don't forget the pctf prefix and the curly braces. By the way, I hope the Easter egg helped speed things up a bit :) Happy hunting at the CTF --dm //
